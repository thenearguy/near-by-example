## Learn: Your Basic Training Ground

This folder is your launchpad into the world of smart contract development! Here, you'll find a treasure trove of fundamental contracts designed to equip you with the building blocks for success.

**What's Inside?**

* **Hello, World!** - A classic introduction, this contract demonstrates the basic structure of a smart contract.
* **Counting Up** - Get your hands dirty with the `Counter` contract, exploring how to store and manipulate data (numbers in this case!).
* **Data Types Demystified** - Dive into the world of data with a contract showcasing basic data types like strings and integers.
* **Powerful Collections** - Explore the functionality of vectors, lookup maps (hash maps) and sets - essential tools for organizing your contract data.
* **Functioning on Functions** - This contract delves into the concept of function types, giving you a deeper understanding of how functions interact.
* **Environmental Awareness** - Learn how to work with environmental variables within your contract, allowing it to adapt to its surroundings.
* **Logging Like a Pro** - Master the art of logging messages within your contracts, making debugging and monitoring a breeze.
* **Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3!** - Head over to the `test` folder to discover how to write effective tests and ensure your contracts are functioning as intended.

**Benefits:**

* **Grasp Core Concepts:** Gain a solid understanding of fundamental smart contract functionalities like data storage, manipulation, and interaction.
* **Build a Strong Foundation:** Lay the groundwork for venturing into more complex smart contract development.
