## contract: lookupset

This contract demonstrates the use of a `LookupSet` from the `near_sdk::store` module for efficient management of a set of unique elements.

**This contract deployed under `lookupset.thenearguy.testnet`.**

**Sections:**

* **Dependencies:**
    * `near_sdk`: Provides core functionalities for building NEAR smart contracts.
        * `near`: Macro for defining functions callable from outside the contract.
        * `store::LookupSet`: Data structure for storing unique elements of a specific type.
* **Contract Structure:**
    * `#[near(contract_state)]`: This attribute declares the `Contract` struct as the contract's state. Any changes to its fields will be persisted to the blockchain's storage.
    * `pub struct Contract { ... }`: Defines the `Contract` struct with a single field:
        * `set: LookupSet<u32>`: A `LookupSet` named `set` to store elements of type `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integers). LookupSets are efficient for checking membership and avoid storing duplicate entries.
* **Default Implementation:**
    * `impl Default for Contract { ... }`: This implementation provides a way to easily create a new `Contract` instance with an empty `LookupSet`.
        * `fn default() -> Self { ... }`: This function returns a new `Contract` with a newly created `LookupSet` identified by the unique key `"set_uid_1"` (for internal use).
* **Contract Methods:**
    * `#[near]`: This macro signifies functions callable from outside the contract (through transactions).
    * `impl Contract { ... }`: Defines methods associated with the `Contract` struct.
        * `pub fn insert_elements(&mut self) { ... }`: This function adds elements (u32 values) to the `set` LookupSet. Since LookupSets avoid duplicates, inserting the same value again will be ignored.
        * `pub fn is_present(&self, value: u32) -> bool { ... }`: This function checks if a specific value (u32) exists within the `set` LookupSet. It returns `true` if the value is present, `false` otherwise.
        * `pub fn remove_elements(&mut self, value: u32) { ... }`: This function removes a specific value (u32) from the `set` LookupSet. If the value exists, it will be deleted. This function does not return the deleted value.
* **Unit Tests (Optional):**
    * `#[cfg(test)]`: This block indicates the following code is only compiled and run when the `test` feature is enabled (useful for development and ensuring functionality).
    * `mod tests { ... }`: Defines a module named `tests` to house unit tests for the contract functions.
        * Each test function verifies the expected behavior of the corresponding contract method using assertions.

**Benefits:**

* Efficient set management with the `LookupSet` data structure.
* Easy membership checks for values within the set.
* Elimination of duplicate entries.
