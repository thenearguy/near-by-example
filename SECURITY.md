## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is just a practice repo to learn near smart contract development in Rust, so there is no risk of funds.

But raising issues is welcome if there is anything vulnerable code on these contracts. 

You can contact me for this on [X previous Twitter](https://x.com/thenearguy)

## ⚠️Waring
Never use these contracts to build production-ready DAPPs. These are just for learning purposes. No audit has been done yet.
